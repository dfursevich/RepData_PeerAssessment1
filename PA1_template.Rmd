## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("input/activity.csv")
activity <- transform(activity, date = as.Date(date, "%Y-%m-%d")) 
head(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
activity_date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum, na.action=na.pass)
hist(activity_date$steps, xlab="Steps", ylab="Days", main="")
summary(activity_date$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
activity_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean, na.action=na.exclude)
plot(activity_interval$interval, activity_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps")
activity_interval[max(activity_interval$steps), ]$interval
```

## Imputing missing values
summary(activity$steps)
activity[]

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
